# Bus Management Application

During my second year of computer engineering at university, I undertook a challenging project to complete my first-semester requirements. The project involved the development of a comprehensive bus management application using C# for a prominent transportation company.

The primary objective of this project was to gain a deep understanding of the three critical layers in software architecture: Data Layer (DL), Business Layer (BL), and Presentation Layer (PL), while purposely excluding the use of Backend (BE) technologies. By focusing on these layers individually, I aimed to enhance my proficiency in creating well-structured and scalable software solutions.

To achieve seamless communication between different components of the application, I employed Factory classes to define the passage of objects. This approach ensured a robust and efficient data flow within the system, allowing for better code organization and maintainability.

To handle data storage and retrieval, I utilized XML and XAML languages. Data was collected from XML files, and if any modifications were required to link it with the DataSource, the changes were implemented in the configuration file located in the "bin" directory.

As an additional layer of security, the application was protected by a password, which was stored in the DataSource class. While ensuring ease of access for authorized users, this measure provided a degree of protection against unauthorized access and data breaches.

One of the key highlights of the project was the implementation of a user-friendly interface. I coded the entire graphic surface using UserControl, ensuring a smooth and pleasant user experience during navigation between various application windows. This attention to detail in the user interface aimed to enhance the overall usability and efficiency of the application.

Overall, the bus management application served as an excellent opportunity for me to apply my knowledge in computer engineering to a real-world scenario. It allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in software development, architectural design, and database management, while also honing my skills in C#, XML, and XAML.

I hope you find the application and its functionalities impressive and insightful. If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to ask. Thank you for visiting and exploring my project!
