# Project_Bus_2021

Here is the project carried out in my university, being in the second year of computer engineering I had to present a project to finish my first semester.

This application written in C # allows bus management for a large company. The goal of this project is a comprehensive knowledge of the use of DL BL and PL layers without the use of BE. 

The passage of objects between each project is defined by instances of Factory classes. 

Proficiency in XML and XAML language.
The data is collected from the XML if you feel like modifying it to the DataSource the modification is made in the config file found in bin.

The application is protected by an easily retrievable password in the DataSource class.

The entire graphic surface has been coded in UserControl for a more pleasant ride between each window.

I wish you a good visit.
